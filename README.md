Labeling satellite imagery is a resource-intensive process, requiring significant time and expertise. To address this challenge, semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have emerged as a promising solution to reduce dependency on labeled data while maintaining model performance. This project evaluates the effectiveness of SSL methods—specifically pseudo-labeling and FixMatch—on lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for satellite image classification. We compare three models: Baseline CNN, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet-Lite, across supervised and SSL training strategies.
